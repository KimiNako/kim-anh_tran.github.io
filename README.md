Hello
I am Kim-Anh, a 4th-year student in Computer Science at INSA Toulouse! :)

This repository is the code of my website! 
# https://kiminako.github.io/

Unfortunately, it is currently only available in French and English! :( 
I am working on the Spanish vers! 

Moreover, my portfolio is not complete... I have too many drawings that I would like to show!!! But, I don't want to show them like currently is... For me, it does not take into account UI...

For the moment you could see my artworks here : https://www.deviantart.com/kiminako/gallery/
